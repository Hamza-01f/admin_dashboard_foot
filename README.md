# README for "Analyse et Optimisation des Donn√©es"

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and optimize a provided JSON dataset by designing an efficient database structure. The goal is to eliminate data redundancy and apply database normalization principles. The project also involves creating relational schemas to manage entities such as players, teams, nationalities, and their relationships. Additionally, a dynamic dashboard will be developed to visualize key statistics related to the dataset.
